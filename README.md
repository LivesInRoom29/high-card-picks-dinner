# High Card Picks Dinner
Relationship saver! Help couples, friends, roommates fairly choose who picks dinner, and find quality dinner choices.

## Description
With this app, two players will input their name in the player spots. When the DEAL button is clicked,both players will be dealt a card. The high card earns a point and the first person to score 5 points gets to pick dinner. The API *Deck of Cards* is used for this first part of the app.

Once a score of 5 is reached, the users are taken to a search page, where they can search meals by category. The API *The Meal DB* is called to bring up search results. The results include a link to a recipe page or YouTube video so the users can explore the recipes. Once, they decide what they want, they will click the _+_ to make their selection. This will add the selected recipe to their history, along with the name of the person who picked it and the date.

The history and search can be accessed any time with links in the nav bar.
